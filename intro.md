## 自我介绍
老师好，我是龚开宸，就读于南昌大学数学与计算机学院。在校三年，成绩优异，专业排名在前6%。四六级一次通过。我乐观向上，有着广泛的兴趣爱好, 比如足球、阅读等。	

我在本科期间主要的研究方向是计算机体系结构，在课余时间我做了不少相关的项目，在这里重点介绍两个。一个是基于Logisim 的 RISC-V CPU	，使用 Logisim 制作，利用 python 脚本生成测试电路进行测试，最终CPU可以运行一些简单的 RISC-V 汇编代码，比如 *冒泡排序* 或者是 *递归* 求斐波那契数列。
另一个项目则是为 xv6 这个 类unix 操作系统添加了一些功能，比如系统调用、用户中断；同时也进行了一些优化，比如实现了 copy-on-write 写时复制。

除了体系结构，在深度学习领域我也有所涉猎。我阅读了有关深度学习的经典论文，如 AlexNet, GooLeNet, ResNet 等。在阅读论文后 ，我也尝试用 `pytorh` 对论文里的模型进行复现。最终基于 ResNet 搭建了一个野生动物分类器。

除了学业，我也积极参与社会活动。曾经作为志愿者参加了2021年的南昌大学百年校庆和2022年的全国互联网+大赛。

Good morning! I am delighted to be here for this interview.

Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Gongkaichen, and I am currently an undergraduate student at NanChan University, majoring in Computer Science.

I consider myself to be open-minded and always willing to lend a helping hand to others. I have a particular affinity for engineering, specifically in the areas of software programming and hardware design. Over the past three years, I have successfully completed two noteworthy projects.

One of my projects involved developing a fully functional CPU capable of running simple RISC-V assembly code. For instance, It can calc Fibonacci number recursively. Another project focused on optimizing the performance of the Unix-like operating system, xv6. I introduced various techniques, such as copy-on-write, which significantly improved its efficiency.

Furthermore, I actively engage in social activities. For example, I had the privilege of being a volunteer in the 7th International Internet+ competition.

While I possess a broad range of interests and have acquired a solid understanding of my field of study, I acknowledge that I still have much to learn and improve upon. I am eager to pursue further studies, as I believe this is essential for realizing my full potential and contributing meaningfully to the field.

Thank you for considering my introduction. I look forward to discussing further and showcasing my enthusiasm for computer science.
