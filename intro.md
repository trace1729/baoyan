## 自我介绍
老师好，我是龚开宸，就读于南昌大学数学与计算机学院。在校排名 12/211, 四六级一次通过。我乐观向上，有着广泛的兴趣爱好, 比如足球、阅读等。	

我在本科期间主要的研究方向是计算机体系结构，在课余时间我做了不少相关的项目，在这里重点介绍两个。一个是基于Logisim 的 RISC-V CPU	，使用 Logisim 制作，利用 python 脚本生成测试电路进行测试，最终CPU可以运行一些简单的 RISC-V 汇编代码，比如 *冒泡排序* 或者是 *递归* 求斐波那契数列。
另一个项目则是为 xv6 这个 类unix 操作系统添加了一些功能，比如系统调用、用户中断；同时也进行了一些优化，比如实现了 copy-on-write 写时复制。

除了体系结构，在深度学习领域我也有所涉猎。我阅读了有关深度学习的经典论文，如 AlexNet, GooLeNet, ResNet 等。在阅读论文后 ，我也尝试用 `pytorh` 对论文里的模型进行复现。最终基于 ResNet 搭建了一个野生动物分类器。

除了学业，我也积极参与社会活动。曾经作为志愿者参加了2021年的南昌大学百年校庆和2022年的全国互联网+大赛。

英文自我介绍

Good morining, I am very glad to be here for this interview.

First, Let me introduce myself, My name is Gongkaichen. I am a undergraduate student in NanChan University, major in Computer science.

I'm open-minded, willing to help others and especially favors engineering such as software programming and hardware design. I've accomplished two system projects during the past three years. One is the full functiong CPU that can run simple risc-v assembly code. For example, calculate fabonaci number recersively. Another is some optimizition technique I adopted to the unix-like operating system xv6. For example, copy on write feature which boost the effiecncy. 

In addition I also participate in some social activities like being a volunteer in the 7th International college student Internet+ competition.

Although I have broad interest in many aspects and grasp the essential part of major, I am not competent to do things professionally oweing lack of ample knowledge and ability. So futher study is urgent to realize my self-value.


第二版

Good morning! I am delighted to be here for this interview.

Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Gongkaichen, and I am currently an undergraduate student at NanChan University, majoring in Computer Science.

I consider myself to be open-minded and always willing to lend a helping hand to others. I have a particular affinity for engineering, specifically in the areas of software programming and hardware design. Over the past three years, I have successfully completed two noteworthy projects.

One of my projects involved developing a fully functional CPU capable of running simple RISC-V assembly code. For instance, I implemented a recursive Fibonacci number calculation. Another project focused on optimizing the performance of the Unix-like operating system, xv6. I introduced various techniques, such as copy-on-write, which significantly improved its efficiency.

Furthermore, I actively engage in social activities. I had the privilege of volunteering in the 7th International College Student Internet+ competition.

While I possess a broad range of interests and have acquired a solid understanding of my field of study, I acknowledge that I still have much to learn and improve upon. I am eager to pursue further studies to enhance my knowledge and skills, as I believe this is essential for realizing my full potential and contributing meaningfully to the field.

Thank you for considering my introduction. I look forward to discussing further and showcasing my enthusiasm for computer science.
